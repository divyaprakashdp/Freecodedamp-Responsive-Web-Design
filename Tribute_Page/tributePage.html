        <h3>Here's a timeline of Bhagat Singh's life:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>1907</strong>
                - Bhagat Singh, a Sandhu Jat, was born in 1907 to Kishan Singh and Vidyavati in Lyallpur district of the Punjab Province of British India.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1910</strong>
                - His uncle, Ajit Singh was forced into exile due to pending court cases against him while Swaran Singh died at home in Lahore in 1910 following his release from jail. Unlike many Sikhs of his age, Singh did not attend the Khalsa High School in Lahore. His grandfather did not approve of the school officials' loyalty to the British government. He was enrolled instead in the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic High School, an Arya Samaji institution.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1919</strong>
                - When he was 12 years old, Singh visited the site of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre hours after thousands of unarmed people gathered at a public meeting had been killed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1922</strong>
                - He laid his helping hands in Gandhiâ€™s non-cooperation movement. This movement was gathering massive support but when Chauri Chaura incident happened in which 22 policemen died, Gandhi called off this movement. Singh became disillusioned with Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence after he called off the non-co-operation movement.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1924</strong>
                - He left home and joined Hindustan Socialist Republican Association(HSRA), which had prominent leaders, such as Chandrashekhar Azad, Ram Prasad Bismil and Shahid Ashfaqallah Khan.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1926</strong>
                - Inspired by the Young Italy movement of Giuseppe Mazzini, he founded the Indian nationalist youth organisation Naujawan Bharat Sabha in March 1926.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1927</strong>
                - Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him in May 1927 on the pretext that he had been involved in a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926. He was released on a surety of Rs. 60,000 five weeks after his arrest. He wrote for, and edited, Urdu and Punjabi newspapers, published in Amritsar and also contributed to low-priced pamphlets published by the Naujawan Bharat Sabha that excoriated the British. He also wrote for Kirti, the journal of the Kirti Kisan Party ("Workers and Peasants Party") and briefly for the Veer Arjun newspaper, published in Delhi. He often used pseudonyms, including names such as Balwant, Ranjit and Vidhrohi.

            <li>

                <strong>1928</strong>
                - British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India. Some Indian political parties boycotted the Commission because there were no Indians in its membership, and there were protests across the country. Lala Lajpat Rai was badly injured in the protests and died later.
                The HSRA vowed to avenge Rai's death. Singh conspired with revolutionaries like Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar, and Chandrashekhar Azad to kill Scott. However, in a case of mistaken identity, the plotters shot John P.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1929</strong>
                - On 8 April 1929, Singh, accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into the Assembly chamber from its public gallery while it was in session. The bombs had been designed not to kill, but some members, including George Ernest Schuster, the finance member of the Viceroy's Executive Council, were injured. The smoke from the bombs filled the Assembly so that Singh and Dutt could probably have escaped in the confusion had they wished. Instead, they stayed shouting the slogan "Inquilab Zindabad!" ("Long Live the Revolution") and threw leaflets. In the leaflet, he stated: "It is easy to kill individuals but you cannot kill the ideas. Great empires crumbled, while the ideas survived." While in prison, Singh and two others had written a letter to Lord Irwin, wherein they asked to be treated as prisoners of war and consequently to be executed by firing squad and not by hanging.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1930</strong>
                - Ended the fast of 116 days. Which he started to be considered, along with others, as a political prisoner. On 7 October 1930, the tribunal delivered its 300-page judgement based on all the evidence and concluded that the participation of Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru in Saunder's murder was proven. They were sentenced to death by hanging.
            </li>
