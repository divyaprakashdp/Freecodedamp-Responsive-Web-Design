                <p>Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing following concepts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Object</li>
                    <li>Class</li>
                    <li>Inheritance</li>
                    <li>Polymorphism</li>
                    <li>Abstraction</li>
                    <li>Encapsulation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Apart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design like Coupling, Cohesion, Association, Aggregation and Composition</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Object">
                <header><h3>Object</h3></header>
                <p>Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike, etc. It can be physical or logical.</p>
                <p>An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory. Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code. The only necessary thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the objects.</p>
                <p>Example: A dog is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc. as well as behaviors like wagging the tail, barking, eating, etc.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Class">
                <header><h3>Class</h3></header>
                <p>Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.</p>
                <p>A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. Class doesn't consume any space.</p>

                <header><h3>Inheritance</h3></header>
                <p>Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).</p>
                <p>The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.</p>

                    class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name

                            Programmer p=new Programmer();
                            System.out.println("Programmer salary is:"+p.salary);

            <section class="main-section" id="Polymorphism">
                <header><h3>Polymorphism</h3></header>
                <p>Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.</p>
                <p>There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.</p>
                <p>If you overload a static method in Java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism. Here, we will focus on runtime polymorphism in java.</p>
                <p>In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass. The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.</p>

                <code>
                class Bike{
                    void run(){System.out.println("running");}
                }
                class Splendor extends Bike{
                    void run(){System.out.println("running safely with 60km");}

                        public static void main(String args[]){
                        Bike b = new Splendor();//upcasting
                        b.run();
                    }

            <section class="main-section" id="Abstraction">
                <header><h3>Abstraction</h3></header>
                <p>Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.</p>
                <p>Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details, for example, sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.</p>
                <p>Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.</p>
                <p>There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Abstract class (0 to 100%)</li>
                    <li>Interface (100%)</li>
                </ol>

                <pre>
                <code>
                abstract class Shape{
                    abstract void draw();
                }

                //In real scenario, implementation is provided by others i.e. unknown by end user
                class Rectangle extends Shape{
                    void draw(){System.out.println("drawing rectangle");}
                }
                class Circle1 extends Shape{
                    void draw(){System.out.println("drawing circle");}
                }

                //In real scenario, method is called by programmer or user
                class TestAbstraction1{
                    public static void main(String args[]){
                        Shape s=new Circle1();//In a real scenario, object is provided through method, e.g., getShape() method
                        s.draw();
                    }

            <section class="main-section" id="Encapsulation">
                <header><h3>Encapsulation</h3></header>
                <p>Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.</p>
                <p>We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private. Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.
                    The Java Bean class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.</p>
